# LargestPerimeterTriangle
Language: C#
Coding Test:  From an array returns the largest triangle perimiter from all possible perrmutations

This was a codility test solution to take any given array, and from all the unique values determine which combinations could form a triangle (Because some combinations mathematically cannot make a triangle)
Then, after determining all possible valid triangles, compare the perminter of each, and return the largest.
If there is no triangle return -1.

I'm sure the execution time could be improved, but it is a functional and readable solution.
